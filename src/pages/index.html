    <h3 class="text-center"><b>Welcome to the homepage of the Dartmouth College Fencing Club!</b></h3>

    <br>
    <p>We are a nationally recognized club team representing Dartmouth College situated in Hanover, New Hampshire. We welcome prospective fencers of all levels; no experience is required to join! Our members range from fencers with over 8 years of experience and multiple competitions behind them, to completely new fencers with no practical experience or knowledge of fencing prior to joining our club. Everyone is welcome; the only thing we require is a genuine interest in fencing, as well as the committment to come to practices and improve as team. </p>

    <p>Our club promotes a culture of inclusivity and diversity; our members come from all walks of life and are involved in many areas on campus, bringing with them valuable experiences and personalities that contribute to our team and fencing community. </p>

    <p>We strive to simultaneously maintain a competitive team that succeeds in tournaments and against other schools, while also promoting a stress free environment for fencing where we can all share our love for the sport. Our team has found many successes both regionally and nationally, regularly placing highly both as a team and as individuals. We have won the Northeastern Club Championship tournament for the past 4 years, and recently, in 2014, we came in 1st as a team at Club Nationals. </p>

    <br>
    <p>We update our website regularly, so please check back for the latest news about DCFC. New members are always welcome, whether they be current Dartmouth students interested in joining the team, or prospective students looking for a vibrant and welcoming community on campus. As an entirely student run club, we would be nothing without our members, past, present, and future. Our members are connected, not only through a love for fencing, but also through bonds that we foster and develop while practicing and competing together. If you are looking for a competitive yet friendly group centered around possibly the coolest sport of all time, look no further than the Dartmouth Fencing Club!</p>
